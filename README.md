# Rotating Square Template for Foundry VTT

Makes the rectangular template square and rotatable. The placement functionality is much closer to that of the circle and you can rotate it to an angle of your choosing.

The size of the square is reported as the length of one edge. For technical reasons, the distance value in the template configuration dialog is half of this. Something to be aware of, in case of more precise adjustments.
